First of the "Mini Project" Series in the DAA Bootcamp.<br>

---

As part of a interview, I was asked to look into a dataset and answer the following questions:<br>
1. Give an **overview** of our business.
2. Where does the company make the **most** money?
3. How can we have less **late deliveries**?<br><br>


### The Data
You can find the data I used for this analysis [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8gx2fvg2k6/5).<br>
This is real data for DataCo Global, which was acquired by Sword Consulting Group. <br><br>


### Key Insights
Here are the most interesting findings:<br>
* The most profitable *category* for the company is **Fishing**.
* The most profitable *product* is the **Perfect Fitness Perfect Rip Deck** in the Cleats Category.
* The *days actual* for shipping are **DOUBLE** the *days scheduled* estimate.
* All of the categories with the *highest delivery rish* include all the highest selling and profiting categories which implies that there is a more overarching issue with shipping within the company.<br><br>


### The Analysis
***An overview of how some of the most important demographics correlate.***<br>

First, I wanted to get a "bird's eye view" of some of the most important demographics for the company. They asked me to include: age, daily rate, distance from home, education, hourly rate, monthly income, monthly rate, number of companies worked, total working years, and training times last year.<br>

I translated this information into this Pairplot matrix:<br>

Based on the visualizations in the matrix, the only real relationships presenting some kind of linear relationship are Age, Monthly Income, and Total Working Years. I looked further into these relationships later in my analysis.<br><br>

<br><br>


### Conclusions
* For this company, the recent high attrition rates are NOT due to the employee age or time of hire.
* The company would benefit from developing campaigns to improve retention rates within the company that focus on the success they can have as they grow and remain loyal.
* Further investigation into "best practices" and company-wide cultural improvements would prove beneficial to attain the company's goal of keeping their talent happy and loyal to them.
