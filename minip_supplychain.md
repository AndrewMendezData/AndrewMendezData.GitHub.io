First of the "Mini Project" Series in the DAA Bootcamp.<br>

---

As part of a interview, I was asked to look into a dataset and answer the following questions:<br>
1. Give an **overview** of our business.
2. Where does the company make the **most** money?
3. How can we have less **late deliveries**?<br><br>


### The Data
You can find the data I used for this analysis [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8gx2fvg2k6/5).<br>
This is real data for DataCo Global, which was acquired by Sword Consulting Group. <br><br>


### Key Insights
Here are the most interesting findings:<br>
* The most profitable *category* for the company is **Fishing**.
* The most profitable *product* is the **Perfect Fitness Perfect Rip Deck** in the Cleats Category.
* The *days actual* for shipping are **DOUBLE** the *days scheduled* estimate.
* All of the categories with the *highest delivery rish* include all the highest selling and profiting categories which implies that there is a more overarching issue with shipping within the company.<br><br>


### The Analysis
#### An Overview of the Highest and Lowest Categories & Products

<img src="images/minip_supplychain1.png?raw=true"><br><br>

In these visuals, we can see that there are about **9 categories** that make up the MAJORITY of the sales and profit for the company. These include: Fishing, Cleats, Camping & Hiking, Cardio Equipment, Women's Apparel, Water Sports, Indoor/Outdoor Games, Men's Footware, and Shop by Sport.<br><br>

An intersting finding here was that although the category with **the highest sales** was Fishing, the product that has the **highest profit margin** comes from the "Cleats" category: *Perfect Fitness Perfect Rip Deck*. It might be beneficial for this company to remove certain categories and place more emphasis on their already popular Fishing Department.<br><br>

Now let's take a look at the lowest performing categories and products:<br>

There are some categories and products here that should be under consideration for removal from their catelog to help streamline their focus into the products and categories that are actually making the company a profit. The **Strength Training** category, along with the **two Ellipticals and the Jolt Slopt Rangefinder** could be removed from focus to help allocate time, energy and money towards the others that are returning revenue.<br><br>


#### A Look Into Shipping



### Conclusions
* For this company, the recent high attrition rates are NOT due to the employee age or time of hire.
* The company would benefit from developing campaigns to improve retention rates within the company that focus on the success they can have as they grow and remain loyal.
* Further investigation into "best practices" and company-wide cultural improvements would prove beneficial to attain the company's goal of keeping their talent happy and loyal to them.
