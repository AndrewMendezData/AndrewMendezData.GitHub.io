<br>

This is the final project in the Data Analytics Accelerator Bootcamp led by Avery Smith (DAA Bootcamp). The intention for this project is be presented with data and the analysis be self-led.<br>

---

### Objective
The goal for this project was to analyze data from Avery's own YouTube Channel and do provide some insights to the following questions:<br>
1. What are the best CTR Videos? What are their titles and thumbnails?
2. What videos drive the most revenue?
3. What videos drive the most subscribers?
4. When do people stop watching videos? What can we change?
<br><br><br>


### The Data
**(The data was provided by Avery in the DAA Bootcamp. Actual data will not be disclosed here for privacy.)**<br>
The data provided contained specifics on average and total watch time by country, video-specific data such as most viewed, highest CTR, total revenue, etc. The date range for this data is March 2020 to October 2023.
<br>
This analysis was done with Excel.
<br><br><br>


### Key Findings
* The video with the *highest click-through rate (CTR)* was "Export Tableau to Image" with a 12.4% CTR.
* The video that *generated the most revenue* for this time period was "AirBnB Data Analystic Project Using SQL". 
* The video that brought in the *most subscribers* was "Building 30 Data Science Projects in 30 Days".
* The *Top 3 Countries* with the most views to Avery's Channel are: The US, India and The United Kingdom.
* The *Average Watch Time per video* based on the top 3 countries is 2:07 minutes.
* The *Age-Range* that watch Avery's Channel the most fall in the 25-34 category. (51%)
* The *Top 3 Sources* that bring in the most views are: External Sources, Shorts Feed, & Browse Features.
<br><br><br>


### The Analysis
#### Here we have the videos with the highest CTR:

<br>

"Export Tableau to Image" has a significantly higher CTR than the next 4 videos. We can also see that the video is *significantly* shorter than the others as well. Based on the average Watch Time per video that we found, we can see that viewers are interested in SHORT videos that get straight to the point. "In less than 1 minute" is **in the title** for this video, therefore displaying its appeal plain and clear.
<br><br>


#### A Look Into Shipping

<br>

When we take a look into the *Scheduled Shipping Day* compared to the ***ACTUAL*** *Shipping Days*, we see that in actuality it takes **TWICE** as long to deliver these products than what is estimated. On the right, we see that the categories with the **Highest Delivery Risk** are congruent with the top performing categories in the company overall. This implies a foundational dysfunction within the shipping department that is permeating across the entire company.
<br><br><br>


### Conclusions
* In regards to the top performing categories, and **lowest** performing, some thought should be brought to eliminating the lowest 25% of these to help reallocate time and energy into those that the company is doing well in. This will help build a brand and customer rapport and ultimately help solidify future success and stability. This could also give the company a chance to refine its direction and vision to help propel its family to future success.
* In terms of the **shipping** and **having less late deliveries**, a thorough process inventory should be taken of the shipping department to help highlight what what systems need to be defined further or create, what current habits or processes are actually *hindering* delivery time, and what plans need to be implemented to help the Shipping Department catch up to the sales that the company is seeing. It seems that the shippping "system" needs to be adjusted to provide the best customer experience with ordering with this company.
<br><br>


I'm would be extremely curious to see ***how*** the company is handling incoming orders, ***how many hands*** does the order go through before it is packaged, what does the ***time to shipment*** process entail and how can we make it ***faster***? Answering these questions will undoudtedly bring this company to the next level and open the door for more sales potential.
