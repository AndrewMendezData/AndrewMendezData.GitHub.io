description: 
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew â€” a data-driven professional with a passion for turning messy problems into actionable insights. My GitHub portfolio highlights projects in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, with a focus on business impact and real-world application.

ðŸ“Š With a background in high-performance operations and team leadership, I bring a unique edge to data work: sharp analytical thinking, stakeholder empathy, and a bias toward clarity and execution. I love using Python, SQL, and Excel to make data not just readable â€” but meaningful.

ðŸ§° Tools I work with: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL, Jupyter Notebooks, Excel/PowerQuery, and a growing toolkit in BI and data storytelling.

ðŸš€ Always exploring new datasets, new tools, and new ways to add value through data.
