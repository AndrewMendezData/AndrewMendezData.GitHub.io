This project was the third in the Data Analytics Bootcamp led by Avery Smith. This project helped me explore more Advanced SQL and see which tools are at our disposal as analysts to extract meaning from data.<br>

Hospitals are one the most important "arteries of society", if you will. They help keep communities healthy and live longer lives. It's important, though, to do a self-check to ensure that hospitals are running efficiently and are producing the result that they are meant to produce. An big-picture analysis could help give us some insight into what needs to improve to continue provide quality care in hospitals around the country.<br>

### Objectives
*I am assisting some hospital administrators in answers the following questions:*
<ol>
  1. What is the distribution of time spent in the hospital?
  2. Is there a relationship between the number of procedures a patient has and how long they stay in the hospital?
  3. What medical specialties are doing the most number of procedures on average?
  4. Is the hospital treating patients of different races differently, specifically with the number of lab procedures done?
  5. The Hospital Administrators wanted to highlight some of the biggest success stories of the hospital. They are looking for instances where patients came into the hospital with an emergency (admission_type_id of 1) but stayed less than the average time in the hospital.
  6. A written summary for the top 50 patients in procedures and total medications.
</ol>

### The Data!
The data is from a Kaggle dataset containing information on 130 US Hospitals from the years 1999-2008. You can find the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/iabhishekofficial/prediction-on-hospital-readmission/data?select=diabetic_data.csv)

<br>

### Key Insights
*From this analysis, we found:*
<ol>
  1. The most common stay for patients in the hospital is 3 days.
  2. The time that patients stay in the hospital increases in relation to the amount of procedures that patient has received.
  3. It appears that Thoracic Surgery has the highest average procedures across all the medical specialties in included in this dataset.
  4. African Americans have the highest average rate of procedures overall.
</ol>

In the dashboard above, starting on the left, we have the bottom tier of schools with the lowest graduation rates. Following that in the center in blue is the relationship between class size and graduation rates displaying an increase in graduation rate along with an increase in class size. On the right, we see the four school who have 4th Graders averaging at the 50th percentile or better.<br><br>

### What Are Our Next Steps?
This data will inform decisions on fund allocation and curriculum creation for the bottom tiers of schools not performing their best. There will be discussion on class size and how to maintain the optimum class size throughout all levels of grade school. Further analysis into the most effective class size could follow this analysis and would prove to be of great value considering the scatter plot in the center. In regards to the 4th Grade Math scores, discussion will definitely need to be had regarding curriculum as well as teaching methods to help bring up the scores in this population. Early intervention is key to future success.
