# Can We A(Mass) Higher Math Scores?

This project was the second in the Data Analytics Bootcamp led by Avery Smith. This project helped me explore Tableau and its power in creating eye-catching graphics that help illustrate key findings.<br>

In this project, we explored some data on the Massachusetts Public School system for the year 2017.<br>

There is no doubt that your 4th Grade Math Teacher was RIGHT! **You WILL use math throughout your entire life; not just in school.** It's no wonder why schools place such a huge emphasis on getting their students more fluent in mathematics. The State of Massachusetts has requested an overview of the current (2017) state of their public schools, focusing in on math performance in 4th grade classrooms, to strategize next steps in getting their kids on the right track before heading into middle school and beyond.<br>

*They are interested in a few things:*
<ol>
  1. What is the current state of schools in Massachusetts?<br>
  2. Which schools are the top performing?<br>
  3. Which schools need more help?<br>
  4. Does class size affect college admission?
</ol>

### Let's Start with the Data!

In the dashboard above, starting on the left, we have the bottom tier of schools with the lowest graduation rates. Following that in the center in blue is the relationship between class size and graduation rates displaying an increase in graduation rate along with an increase in class size. On the right, we see the four school who have 4th Graders averaging at the 50th percentile or better.<br><br>

### What Are Our Next Steps?
This data will inform decisions on fund allocation and curriculum creation for the bottom tiers of schools not performing their best. There will be discussion on class size and how to maintain the optimum class size throughout all levels of grade school. Further analysis into the most effective class size could follow this analysis and would prove to be of great value considering the scatter plot in the center. In regards to the 4th Grade Math scores, discussion will definitely need to be had regarding curriculum as well as teaching methods to help bring up the scores in this population. Early intervention is key to future success.
