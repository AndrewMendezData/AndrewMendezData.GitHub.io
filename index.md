# Welcome to My Data Portfolio

Hi, I’m Andrew — currently a Senior II Manager at The Cheesecake Factory and a student in TripleTen’s 10-month Data Science program. I’m passionate about using data to solve real business problems, uncover insights, and tell clear, compelling stories. My background in leading high-volume operations has sharpened my ability to think critically, collaborate cross-functionally, and make data-informed decisions under pressure.

<u>You’ll find two repositories here</u>: the first features data analysis and visualization projects I completed during the **Avery Smith Data Career Jumpstart Bootcamp**, and the second showcases my latest work from the **TripleTen Data Science** program (Expected Graduation, Sept 2025), where I’m diving deeper into machine learning, statistical modeling, and end-to-end project workflows.

Let’s connect! I’m always open to feedback, collaboration, or just chatting about data, leadership, or how we can build smarter, more efficient systems together.
