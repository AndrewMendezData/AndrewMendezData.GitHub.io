# 🧠 Data Analyst Projects – Focus on Data Visualization

Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects that highlight my skills in **data analysis** and **data visualization**. Each project is designed to extract insights from real-world datasets and present them in a clear, visual format using tools like Python, SQL, Excel, and visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau.

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Interactive dashboards
- Charts and visual stories from raw data
- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps
- Insights and summaries from various datasets

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **SQL**
- **Excel**
- **Tableau / Power BI**

## 📈 Goal

The main goal of these projects is to turn data into meaningful visual insights that inform decision-making and storytelling. Whether it's exploring trends, detecting anomalies, or building dashboards, visualization is the key focus.
